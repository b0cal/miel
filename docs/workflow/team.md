- Every team member is responsible for unit testing on its own features before
  delivering them

- Every team member is responsible for documenting its own features

- Even if any team member could work on any part of the application, every
  member is responsible for a part of the architecture

## Communication

### Channels

Keeping good and efficient communication between team members is key to
consistency, therefore two main communication channels have been adopted.

Daily meetings are attended through the Teams team

Then for questions or remarks that are worth for documenting the project
timeline (architecture, conception, etc.) add comments to your issues and ping
people you want help from. On the other hand don't forget to frequently verify
your Github notifications so you don't miss them

## Agile methodology

Based on the relatively low time assigned to this project, sprints of 3 days
have been chosen.

### Sprint events

1. Sprint planning At the beginning of every sprint, a meeting is appointed to
   define sprint objectives, select features to implement, define the acceptance
   criteria and fragment the backlog elements in smaller chunks of work that
   should take less than a day
2. Daily Scrum 15 minutes meetings to discuss progress and issues, output should
   be an action plan for the day. Two daily scrums must be attended, first one
   at 09:30AM aiming at planning the day and discuss previous day issues. Second
   one at 01:30PM to adjust daily work
3. Sprint review At the end of every sprint, useful to plan next activities,
   discuss actual status of the dev. etc.

### Project timeline visualization

We use a Kanban to visualize work that needs to be done for the sprint in
progress

3 columns:

- Todo: Contains the whole backlog of the sprint
- In progress: Tasks in progress
- Done: PR has been closed, tests passed
